title: What are shelves?

SubGit uses shelves as a storage for what in SVN is called ‘anonymous branch’
If shelves are not used, some of anonymous SVN branches might get lost as well as the history of merges with those branches.
If one wants to switch shelves off, all is needed to do is to find in the SubGit configuration file the block where trunk and other branches are defined and just to remove this line:

	  shelves = shelves/*:refs/shelves/*
